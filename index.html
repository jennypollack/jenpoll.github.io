  <h1>Hey! I'm Jenny</h1>
  <p>Welcome</p>

  <p class="view"><a href="https://github.com/jenpoll" target="_blank">View My GitHub Profile</a></p>

  <p>I grew up in Michigan, just outside of Detroit. I moved to Seattle in the beginning of September 2015 for a Code Fellows course focusing on full-stack Javascript.</p>
  <p>I have a major in Environmental Studies and a minor in Computer Science from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor (I graduated May 2014).</p>
  <p> I like the intersection between internet and people in real life outside of the computer.</p>
  <p>I think industrial agriculture is a bummer and though I definitely make use of it, I think we can do better.</p>
